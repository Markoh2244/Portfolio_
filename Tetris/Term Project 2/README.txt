Description and Directions: In this project, I built a Minesweeper game. To run it open download 112 graphics in the same file as the program then open Main.py. Then run it in Vscode by clicking Command B(Google how to run vscode for other OS). It has three levels the user can choose from. To select a tile make sure that the color is set to gray.
You can do this by clicking on the gray tile in the bottom left of the screen. If the tiles are not opeinging right away, it means a tile with a bomb or number has been selected.
Keep trying unitl you find an empty square. To flag a tile you can select the red square at the bottom left of the screen. You keep doing this until you flag all the finds or hit a 
bomb while demining. 

Modules used: cmu_112_graphics
